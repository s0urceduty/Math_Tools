Sourceduty has developed frameworks such as Comtag, Contripot, Factorchain, ImpactQ, Linear Matrix, Modbias, Navisol, Passaffect, Quadexpo, Reactivar, Signal Optimate, Signal Wave, Truthvar, and the extensive Optimation Theorem. Each framework includes a structured text file outlining its core theory, use cases, and potential computational applications. These functions are presented not only as abstract mathematical ideas but also as programmable tools, often accompanied by Python examples, topological diagrams, and explanatory images. Their collective focus lies in creating computational models that optimize logic, algebraic processes, signal analysis, and even quantum mechanics. Many of them aim to redefine or extend conventional mathematical domains—Factorchain, for example, offers a unique approach to prime decomposition and algebraic layering.

A particularly ambitious concept is the Optimation Theorem, which spans multiple subtopics including Boolean logic enhancement, quantum optimation, and CPU-level computational efficiency. This framework goes beyond theoretical abstraction by proposing practical implementations such as VQE (Variational Quantum Eigensolver) models and terminal-based tools for quantum variable addition. The function is described as a method of systematically improving system performance through a set of algebraic and logical transformations. The documents also hint at real-world implications, such as saving billions in operational costs for major corporations, demonstrating a strong focus on computational efficiency, automation, and machine learning readiness. Sourceduty’s work in this area represents an effort to create universal frameworks that can integrate with existing computational architectures.

Other functions like Modbias, Passaffect, and Truthvar explore behavioral or probabilistic domains of logic, resembling concepts in fuzzy logic or adaptive algorithms. For example, Modbias appears to focus on quantifying modular biases in data or algorithms, potentially for use in AI ethics or algorithmic fairness. Passaffect introduces a form of logical flow control or variable interaction across multiple function layers—suggestive of a programming or modeling paradigm that mimics decision-making in dynamic systems. Truthvar, with its attention to truth variation and contextual logic, could be leveraged in decision systems or AI-driven verification processes. Collectively, Sourceduty’s functions provide a powerful foundation for researchers and developers seeking to push the boundaries of applied mathematics in computational and theoretical contexts.
